At Octi, I created flashy “sizzle-reels” and translated upper managements’ ideas into video presentations. Rather than allocate designers/engineers to producing prototypes (a costly and timely process), management would have me execute an entire video representation of a future/conceptual product. This video includes some of my concepts and sizzle-content. These examples were approved to be shown...I'm unable to publicly post my latest work.
