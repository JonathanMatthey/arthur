<p>
At Octi, I created flashy “sizzle-reels” and translated upper managements’ ideas into video presentations.
</p>
<p>Rather than allocate designers/engineers to producing prototypes (a costly and timely process), management would have me execute an entire video representation of a future/conceptual product.
</p>
<p>This video includes some of my concepts and sizzle-content. These examples were approved to be shown...
</p>
<p>I'm unable to publicly post my latest work.
