In 2017, I produced and acted in a short film with my childhood friend (and SAG actor) Tyler Voss. We shot the film on a Black Magic Ursa in Rancho Santa Margarita and Carlsbad. Our budget consisted of gas to get our crew to-and-from the set and lunch! I had the privilege of tackling the bulk of the editing: including the 3D animated photography credits. The film was screened at the 2018 Suburban Nightmares Film Festival in Mission Viejo.
