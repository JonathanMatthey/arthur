At Octi, I was frequently tasked with creating videos of products that didn’t exist yet. At Octi, we created a video platform that allows users to “greenscreen” themselves out of their real-world environment in real time…all powered by a modern cellphone. I produced this video and shot it at Forever 21 on Hollywood Blvd. Our company built the technological infrastructure to support this type of branded consumer experience.
