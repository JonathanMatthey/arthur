<p>Over 120 children are competent swimmers thanks to “Saints and Swimmers”, an all-volunteer organization dedicated to teaching water-safety and swimming skills in underserved communities.  It is my privilege to film, edit, and produce promotional/volunteer recruitment videos for this worthy organization since its inception in 2013.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hadjQH5vubU">Year 1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvDQBZeOTL0">Year 2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpbHqLeCaKo">Year 3</a></p>
