I have been a trained singer for 14 years. Apart from being the lead singer of a coverband in highschool, I also sang complicated choral arrangements on tour in Hawaii. While at Notre Dame, I toured with our University's Chorale and sang for Pope Benedict at the Vatican.

With a range from Bass II to Tenor I, I can also perform a slew of uncanny impersonations including (but definitely not limited to): Spongebob, Marlon Bradno, and a Russian accent.
