Tasked with inheriting and transitioning the massive geographically targeted Lexus campaigns, I quickly abosrbed processes for executing VAST, 1x1, and banner ads.  Innovid's integration offerings forced me to dig deep into analytics and as an account manager, I was frequently relied on to solve discrepancies and optimize performance mid-campaign.  With my background in interactive HTML VPAID technology, Innovid allocated me to interactive-inclined clients such as Oculus Facebook, Western Governors University, LesSchwab Tires, HP, and Disney.  I was reponsible for rendered VAST creative QA for Disney's non-interactive inventory.  My ad campaigns gathered hundreds of millions of impressions.</p>

Our videos have gathered millions of impressions.  I worked with the engineering and design teams to perfect our production software with a filmmaker's perspective.  I assisted in designing a "tagger": which allowed users of any skill-level to track items/people in videos with state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms. Towards the end of Fuisz Video's exciting existence, I became internationally client-facing as a campaign manager.  We ran our interactive experiences as standalone HTML videos, VPAID Flash, VPAID.JS, and MRAID complete with third-party tracking.  My team was also responsible for the QA of every video experience and the entire Fuisz proprietary creation platform. </p>
